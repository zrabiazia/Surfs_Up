# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview:

W. Avy likes to get more information about temperature trends for month od July and December before open the surf shop, to determine if the surf and ice cream shop will be sustainable all year around. I will be using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy to gather data and filter them for month of June and December and create a statistical summary for W. Avy to compare both months for temperature trends.

## Results:

### June’s Statistical Summary:
In Month of June, the temperature usually hikes up because of hot sun. the Temperature count is 1700, Mean is 74.94, STD is 3.25, min and max temperature is 64 ,85.
### December’s Statistical Summary:
In December, the total count was 1517. Mean was 71.04 and STD was 3.74. Minimum and maximum temperature was 56 and 83.
### Comparison between June and December statistical summary:
The maximum temperature in both months (June, December) is 85 and 83, which is not a huge difference.

The Mean between June and December temperature is 74.94 and 71.04.

The STD for June is 3.25, lower than December month is 3.75.

The minimum temperature has a big difference. The minimum temperature for June is 64 which is high.

And in December the minimum temperature is low which is 56. December is colder month of the year.

## Summary:

In Surfs Up Analysis, we used Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy to gather and filtered data and create the statistical summary to determine the stability of business in June and December.
The statistical summary for June and December temperature does not have a huge difference. The June’s temperature count is higher than the December’s count. The mean for each month is relatively not too far from each other (June Mean 74.94), (December Mean 71.04).  Maximum temperature in both months are the highest temp which shows that surfs Up and ice cream shop will be sustainable in the high temperature. The minimum temperature for each month has 8 points difference (June min temp 64), (December min temp 56). The minimum and maximum temperature does not stop people to enjoy the ice cream or Surf. The 25%,50% and 75% of each month is relatively similar, does not have huge difference.  With the statistical summary, W. Avy will be able to keep the business going through out the year. 
If W. Avy wants to get more statistical summaries for the Temperature in Oahu, he can analyse the moth of July and January. Month of July will be the next month after the mid season and January will be beginning of the new year moth, to determine if the business is sustainable through out the season, rough and though temperature.
